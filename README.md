# DecipheringPianoMusic
A self-directed project that discovers techniques of conducting Fourier Analysis to analyze musical notes in music

A piano chord (+3 piano keys) creates a superimposed wave. The points on the wave are transferred into a program which calculates the distrubution of frequencies across a range that is perceptible to the human ear (0 Hz - 2000 Hz roughly).This is completed by means of the Discrete Fourier Transform. By determining the values of the frequencies that compose the wave, one can identify the particular piano keys that correspond to each frequency.
